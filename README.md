# Task Manager Api

A demonstration of my workflow process on a sample project.

## Architecture Choices

- Working with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to keep functionality isolated and easy to add to.
- `xUnit` with `Moq`, `AutoFixture` and `FluentAssertions` for testing.
- Implementing a personal twist on [Clean Architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/) as described by [Jason Taylor](https://github.com/jasontaylordev), based on concepts from [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## Testing Choices

- I've elected to try my hand at the `test-first` approach for this project. It led to some running around a little clueless on how to start and how far to define by base abstraction.

Time Spent: 8 hours.
